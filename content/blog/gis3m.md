The GIS3M held an <a href="http://www.gdegem.org/international-workshop" target="_blank">international 
workshop</a> in Marseille on the conservation of Bottlenose dolphin conservation and monitoring 
in the North-Western Mediterranean Sea. This was the opportunity to discuss the results of 
the <a href="http://www.gdegem.org/rapports" target="_blank">GDEGeM project</a> on the 
same topic. I mostly contributed by analysing the tons of photo-IDs that were 
collected during the program to estimate abundance and analyze the social structure.
