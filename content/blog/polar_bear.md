My post-doc Sarah Cubaynes and I went to visit our colleague 
<a href="http://www.npolar.no/en/people/jon.aars/" target="_blank">Jon Aars</a> in 
Tromso, Norway. We are working together on the demography of polar bears using an amazing dataset 
the <a href="http://www.npolar.no/en/" target="_blank">Norwegian Polar Institute</a> has 
been collecting for decades. It was also the opportunity to catch up with 
<a href="https://uit.no/om/enhet/ansatte/person?p_document_id=41160&p_dimension_id=88165" target="_blank">Nigel (Gilles) 
Yoccoz</a> who's being very helpful with this project. Jon took us fishing; I was luckier than with fly-fishing ;-)
