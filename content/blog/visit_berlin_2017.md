I spent 3 days in Berlin at the [Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife 
Research](http://www.leibniz-izw.de/welcome.html) catching up with friends and 
colleagues (L. Marescot, S. Benhaim, S. Kramer-Schadt, A. Courtiol, H. Hofer).

We talked about spotted hyenas and monitoring of large carnivores. I also gave a workshop 
on inferring occupancy using HMM. I even got in touch with an old acquaintance - Steve 
Beissinger - who happens to be in Berlin for the year. Steve will come and visit us 
in Montpellier for a few days in May.
