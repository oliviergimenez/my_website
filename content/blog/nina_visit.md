I had the visit of Nina Santostasi from Italy to work for a few days on the estimation 
of striped dolphin abundance in the gulf of Corinth (in Greece). Nina is working with 
Giovanni Bearzi and Silvia Bonizzoni from the <a href="http://www.dolphinbiology.org/about.htm" target="_blank">NGO 
Dolphin Biology</a> and Conservation. Hopefully our collaboration will provide elements 
for the conservation of the species.
