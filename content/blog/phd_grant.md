Great news! Gilles Maurer will soon start his PhD on the links between wild and captive 
populations of Asian elephants using an interdisciplinary approach. This is a joint 
venture with the <a href="https://www.zoobeauval.com/" target="_blank">Beauval zoo</a> 
and B. Mulot through the <a href="http://www.anrt.asso.fr/fr/espace_cifre/mode_emploi.jsp#.VS6EqGZGFpk" target="_blank">CIFRE 
framework</a> that funds applied PhDs with non-academic partners.
