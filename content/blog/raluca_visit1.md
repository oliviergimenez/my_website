I had the visit of  <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Raluca_Bancila" target="_blank">Raluca 
Bancila</a> a research scientist from Romania. We investigated spatio-temporal environmental variation 
in and individual heterogeneity on emigration/immigration rates of the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troglofauna" target="_blank">troglophile harvestmen 
species</a> Paranemastoma silli with capture-recapture models. We used two P. silli populations 
inhabiting two caves, Closani and Lazului Caves, located in the Mehedinti Mountains in southwestern 
Romania. Yes, we do not only work on big emblematic mammal species ;-)
On a personal side, Raluca is always smiling and laughing – ‘la banane’ like we say in French, 
it was so good to have her in the team. I’m looking forward to hosting her again!
