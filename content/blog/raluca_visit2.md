[Raluca Bancila](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Raluca_Bancila), who visited us 
back in 2015, is with us again for a short 2-week visit. We will resume a project we 
started one year ago on the evaluation of demographic parameters of two related species 
of spadefoot toads (Pelobates syriacus and P. fuscus) from the [Danube Delta 
Biosphere Reserve](http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/588), Romania, using capture-recapture models.
