Laetitia Blanc succesfully defended her PhD on the conservation of lynx in France. 
Congrats Laeti! She had very nice feedbacks by the members of committee (X. Lambin, 
E. Marboutin, J. Linnell, M. Schaub and F. Bonadonna). Laetitia will be working for 
a few months with us on the estimation of lynx abundance in Norway (with J. Linnell) 
and with ONCFS to finish up a chapter of her thesis.
