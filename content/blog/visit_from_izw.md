I had the visit of Sarah Benhaim and Lucile Marescot (a former PhD student of mine), 
both post-doc at the Leibniz Institute in Berlin supervised 
by <a href="http://www.izw-berlin.de/kramer-schadt-stefanie.html" target="_blank">Stephanie 
Kramer-Schadt</a>. It was an exciting week that we spent discussing and analyzing 
data on the spotted hyenas from the Serengeti National Park with questions at the 
interface of demography, sociality and epidemiology. This is joint work with Heribert 
Hofer and Marion East.
