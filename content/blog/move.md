Our team has recently joined the department Biodiversity & Conservation at CEFE, a 
department that I have the pleasure to head now. We have moved offices and are now 
on the second floor. I have an office with a brand new parquet floor and red walls 
(that I chose and installed/painted myself, can you believe it?!). We had our 
office-warming party early March. Do not hesitate to come by and visit our new 
offices!
