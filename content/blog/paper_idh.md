I just submitted to Oikos a paper entitled "Individual heterogeneity and 
capture-recapture models: what, why and how?". A pre-print is available 
[here](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/03/26/120683). I also provide R codes 
on GitHub [there](http://bit.ly/2nqWzoZ).

This is joint work with Emmanuelle Cam and 
Jean-Michel Gaillard. This work was greatly inspired by my HDR I defended back in 2010 
(!) and the ANR project I got over the period 2008-2011 (re-!).
