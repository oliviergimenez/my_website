I'm so delighted to announce that Julie will start a PhD in October with me, jointly 
working with Eric Marboutin and Christophe Duchamp from 
<a href="http://www.oncfs.gouv.fr/" target="_blank">ONCFS</a>. There will be 
also collaborations with 
<a href="http://www.nina.no/english/Contact/Employees/Employee-info/AnsattID/12310" target="_blank">John 
Linnell </a>from NINA. She'll be studying the various ways to assess the distribution of 
large carnivores and methods to optimise the associated monitoring protocols.
