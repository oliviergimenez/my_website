Sending questionnaires for Blaise's PhD to study the local perception of the presence of 
brown bears in the Pyrénées. First picture, the 3000 questionnaires to be sent; second picture, 
those questionnaires once packed in boxes; third picture, the nice guy from the mail company 
La Poste comes and picks them up. Now the question is how many of them we will we get back?...
