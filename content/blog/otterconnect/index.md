I'm starting a new project on the Eurasian otter to better understand its recolonization in France. 

<!--more-->

In the `OtterConnect` project, we aim at providing an operational framework for assessing socio-ecological connectivity for small carnivores which influence the dynamics of ecosystems and provide numerous ecosystem services. We focus on the Eurasian otter (*Lutra lutra*) an umbrella and indicator species of blue and green infrastructures. To know more about the project and get news, please visit our website <https://otterconnect.netlify.app/en/>.
