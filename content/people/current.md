**Marwan Naciri** (PhD 2021-2024) is studying the demography of polar bears. He is co-supervised by Sarah Cubaynes and Jon Aars.

**Deborah Coz** (PhD 2021-2024) is using games and companion modelling to build social-ecological communities and enrich animal geography. She is supervised by Raphaël Mathevet.

**Javi Fernández-López** (post-doc 2022-2023) is interested in conservation biology and phylogeography. He is modelling the distribution of mammals in Europe by integrating various sources of data. Check out his website <https://allthiswasfield.blogspot.com>.

**Mónia Nakamura Mercier Real** (PhD 2019-2024) is investigating the impacts of anthropogenic factors on large carnivores persistence in human-dominated landscapes. She uses wolf in Spain and Portugal as a model species to address how different humanization levels can influence habitat selection and land use, and ultimately affect its demography, status and viability. The thesis is co-supervised with [José Vicente López-Bao](https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=mWcf6MsAAAAJ&hl=es) and [Pedro Monterroso](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2ulB-8QAAAAJ&hl=en).

**Béatrice Chataigner** (EPHE diploma 2020-2022) is working on locally-based monitoring programs in Kenya. Her research project aims at exploring the performances of current ecological monitoring program of Kenyan conservanciesin addressing their needs in terms of adaptive management at local level as well as ecosystem level. Béatrice works for IUCN in the [Program on African Protected Areas and Conservation](https://papaco.org/). Her work is jointly supervised by [Nicholas Pilfold](https://institute.sandiegozoo.org/staff/nicholas-pilfold-phd) and [Aurélien Besnard](https://www.cefe.cnrs.fr/fr/actus/44-french/recherche/bc/bev/291-aurelien-besnard).

![](/img/patricia.jpg) **Patrícia Rodrigues** (post-doc 2021-2023) is interested in the social-ecological dynamics underpinning environmental problems in Africa. Her current project aims to characterize landscapes within Africa’s Great Green Wall in terms of their social-ecological properties and restoration initiatives.
