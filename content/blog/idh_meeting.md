We had a lovely 2-day workshop in Lyon on individual heterogeneity in demography as part 
of <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/gdrecostat/" target="_blank">our research group 
on Statistical Ecology</a>. I gave a short 
talk providing an overview of heterogeneous capture-recapture models. We agreed on 
meeting again early April 2015 to carry out a comparative analysis of individual heterogeneity 
using the datasets shared by the group and the method developed by Hal Caswell (check it 
out <a href="http://www.demographic-research.org/volumes/vol31/19/">here</a>).
