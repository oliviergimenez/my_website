**Maud Quéroué** (PhD 2018-2021) is developing multispecies demographic models to study predator-prey interactions in seabirds and competition/coexistence in passerines. This is joint work with [Christophe Barbraud](http://www.cebc.cnrs.fr/ecomm/Fr_ecomm/equip_CB.html), [Pierre-Yves Henry](http://mecadev.cnrs.fr/index.php?post/Henry-Pierre-Yves) and [Frédéric Barraquand](https://sites.google.com/site/fredbarraquand/home).

**Oksana Grente** (PhD 2018-2021) is evaluating the impact of lethal control on the French wolf population, with a special interest in social structure and livestock depredation. She will also develop an  adaptive management framework based on occupancy models. This is joint work with Christophe Duchamp and Nolwenn Hoguet-Drouet from [French Office of Biodiversity](https://ofb.gouv.fr/).

**Valentin Lauret** (PhD 2018-2021) is developing a structured decision making approach for adaptive monitoring of cetaceans in the network of marine protected areas in the French Mediterranean Sea. This is joint work with Hélène Labach from [GIS3M](https://www.gis3m.org/).

**Mónia Nakamura Mercier Real** (PhD 2019-2024) is investigating the impacts of anthropogenic factors on large carnivores persistence in human-dominated landscapes. She uses wolf in Spain and Portugal as a model species to address how different humanization levels can influence habitat selection and land use, and ultimately affect its demography, status and viability. The thesis is co-supervised with [José Vicente López-Bao](https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=mWcf6MsAAAAJ&hl=es) and [Pedro Monterroso](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2ulB-8QAAAAJ&hl=en).

**Béatrice Chataigner** (EPHE diploma 2020-2022) is working on locally-based monitoring programs in Kenya. Her research project aims at exploring the performances of current ecological monitoring program of Kenyan conservanciesin addressing their needs in terms of adaptive management at local level as well as ecosystem level. Béatrice works for IUCN in the [Program on African Protected Areas and Conservation](https://papaco.org/). Her work is jointly supervised by [Nicholas Pilfold](https://institute.sandiegozoo.org/staff/nicholas-pilfold-phd) and [Aurélien Besnard](https://www.cefe.cnrs.fr/fr/actus/44-french/recherche/bc/bev/291-aurelien-besnard).
