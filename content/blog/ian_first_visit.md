<a href="https://www.newcastle.edu.au/profile/ian-renner" target="_blank">Ian Renner</a> from 
the University of Newcastle in Australia spent some time with us while on a sabbatical. 
We worked together on developing a method to combine sources of information on species 
distribution. Ian brought his sound expertise on the Lasso for covariate selection and 
point processes that provide a nice integrated framework. It was fun to program in R 
in parallel. I wish I could do that more often. We even managed (credit goes to Ian) 
to present something at the 
International Statistical Ecology Conference.

On a personal side, Ian has 
become a friend, his kindness and interest in other people are amazing.
