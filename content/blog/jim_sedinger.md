<a href="http://www.ag.unr.edu/sedinger/" target="_blank">Jim Sedinger</a>, professor 
at the University of Nevada (Reno), said goodbye to the team after 3 months with us 
on a sabbatical. Itâ€™s been great to have Jim here analyzing data collected as part 
of the amazing Black Brant monitoring initiated in the 40s. More soon on our joint 
project on senescence and individual heterogeneity.
