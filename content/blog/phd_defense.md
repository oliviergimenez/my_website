I acted as the "president" on the PhD committee of Sophie Monsarrat who, with her 
supervisor Ana Rodrigues, kindly invited me. It was about the reconstruction of marine 
mammalâ€™s historical distribution and abundance using historical data. Sophie did an 
amazing job during her PhD, have a look 
to <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270506527_Historical_summer_distribution_of_the_endangered_North_Atlantic_right_whale_%28Eubalaena_glacialis%29_a_hypothesis_based_on_environmental_preferences_of_a_congeneric_species" target="_blank">her 
recent paper</a> on the topic. Her presentation was just awesome, I wish I could 
give such vivid and fascinating talks, irrespective of the topic. Otherwise, her 
work reminded me of my current work on monk seals with Alex Karamanlidis from the 
MoM NGO and the talk I'm supposed to give at the ICCB2015 on the analysis of citizen 
science data. More soon.
