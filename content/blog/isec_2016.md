I attended the [International Statistical Ecology Conference in 
Seattle](http://depts.washington.edu/uwconf/wordpress/isec2016/). I donâ€™t go often 
to conferences, but I do my best not to miss that one.

This 
year, clearly, hidden Markov models (HMM) were on the lips of everyone. Well, it was 
cool to realize that I wasn't too "has been" by giving a [1-day workshop on fitting 
occupancy models with HMM](http://depts.washington.edu/uwconf/wordpress/isec2016/workshops/) 
and program E-SURGE developed in our team. 

I also gave a talk on the use of PCA to deal 
with many correlated covariated in capture-recapture models.

I also co-authored a talk that Ian Renner (see below) gave on combining sources of 
information on species distribution.
