The team run two 1-week workshops on <a href="http://multievent.sciencesconf.org/" target="_blank">capture-recapture 
models</a> and <a href="http://matrixmodels.sciencesconf.org/" target="_blank">matrix models</a>. 
We're grateful to all the attendees who came, with fascinating research topics and stimulating 
questions. No need to say that your presence means a lot to us! We hope to see again many 
people next year! Warm and special thanks to <a href="http://www.cnr.usu.edu/htm/facstaff/koons-page" target="_blank">Dave 
Koons</a>, <a href="http://liseaubry.webs.com/" target="_blank">Lise Aubry</a> and Pamela 
Lagrange!
