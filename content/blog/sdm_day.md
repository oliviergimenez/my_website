Taking the opportunity of Ian Renner’s visit, we organized thanks to 
the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/gdrecostat/" target="_blank">GdR 
EcoStat</a> a conference on the recent advances in the modeling of species 
distribution. We were lucky to have the cream of researchers in the domain with 
Julien Papaïx, Joseph Chipperfield, Ian Renner, Joern Pagel, Bob O’Hara, Laura 
Pollock and Damaris Zurell. The talks are 
available <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/gdrecostat/reunions/sdm-day" target="_blank">here</a>.
