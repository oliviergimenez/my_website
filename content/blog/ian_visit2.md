[Ian Renner](https://www.newcastle.edu.au/profile/ian-renner) from the University of 
Newcastle in Australia, who visited us back in 2015, is with us again for a short 3-week 
visit. 

<!--more-->

We resumed the work we started one year ago on developing a method to combine 
sources of information on species distribution. We also started a new project on model 
selection in occupancy and capture-recapture models using the LASSO.
