Great news! Our project on "Scenarios for coexistence between men and dolphins on the Mediterranean 
French littoral" will be funded by [Fondation de France](https://www.fondationdefrance.org/en). 

<!--more-->

In this project, we will propose management strategies for human activities and populations of bottlenose dolphins to coexist. 
Building on the [GDEGeM project](https://www.gdegem.org/), we will adopt an ecological approach to infer the spatio-temporal 
distribution of dolphins and their interactions with human activities, and a sociological 
approach to explore the attitudes and perceptions of local actors towards dolphins. 
We will resort to participatory modeling to build, test and use a model to assess 
management strategies collectively. 

In passing, I kind of liked the selection procedure: 
we first submitted a written application, then were asked to come for an interview. 
I could answer the questions of the committee and have a direct feeling of what they 
were thinking of our project. 

We will start this project officially by the end of 
the year, more soon.
