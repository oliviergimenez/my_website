Just submitted a big proposal to the [Biodiversa 
call](http://www.biodiversa.org/). It was great to write this project 
with [Herv√© Fritz](https://lbbe.univ-lyon1.fr/-Fritz-Herve-.html) who, 
without a doubt, knows how to write grant applications! If successful, we'll be 
working on the social and ecological dimensions of connectivity in lynx habitats. 
This is joint work with French, Swiss, German, Norwegian and Swedish colleagues. 
More soon hopefully.


**Update**: On May 2016, I received the news that our project was rejected. 
Big disappointment. But hey, that's life, and this project is awesome, 
we'll find other ways to implement it!
