We held AppliBugs in Montpellier, with the idea to stimulate exchanges and to share 
information on Bayesian methods and applications 
([program here](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/23160641/my-pubs/annonceAppliBugs-28novembre-Montpellier.pdf)). 
The day went well despite a rainstorm falling on Montpellier. All talks were 
great, and I was particularly interested in Adrien Todeschini's presentation of 
[Biips](http://https://alea.bordeaux.inria.fr/biips/doku.php), 
a software allowing the implementation of state-space models using particle filtering and 
a R/BUGS-like syntax.
