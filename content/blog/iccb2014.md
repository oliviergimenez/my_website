I attended the <a href="http://www.iccb-eccb2015.org/" target="_blank">International 
Congress on Biological Conservation</a> that was held in my home town Montpellier. 
The students of our team were on fire and talked about their exciting work. Gilles 
presented a 
bio-economic model to study the population dynamics of Asian captive elephants, 
a nice example of how to explicitly incorporate interactions between captive and wild 
populations in species management.

Julie talked about her use of opportunistic data to map the colonisation of the wolf in France; this is a neat 
example of how to generate non-detections by carefully assessing the observation efforts 
to use dynamic occupancy models. 

Anne-Sophie presented 
an 
application of Poisson point process modeling to map the presence of brown bear presence in 
Greece using citizen science data with possible observer bias.

Blaise presented his 
results on a 
sociological survey to assess the attitudes of local residents towards the presence of Brown 
bears in the Pyrenees.

Last, Laetitia had a poster on the use of 
a 
spatially explicit individual-based model to explore the best strategies (reintroductions 
and / or corridors) to restore the population of lynx in the Vosges mountains.

I 
gave a talk 
on a 
review of the methods to analyse citizen science data. This was part of a symposium (nicely 
summarised by Muki Haklay <a href="https://povesham.wordpress.com/2015/08/04/notes-from-iccbeccb-2015-day-2-citizen-science-data-quality/" target="_blank">here</a>) 
organised by Karine Princé and Wes Hochachka. Stay tuned, a paper is on its way!

Overall, the program 
of this conference was dense, the talks and discussions between sessions were stimulating, 
I’m looking forward to attending the next one!
