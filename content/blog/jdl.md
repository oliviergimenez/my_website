<a href="http://www.cefe.cnrs.fr/fr/recherche/bc/bbp/843-c/256-jean-dominique-lebreton" target="_blank">Jean-Dominique 
Lebreton</a> went on retirement, and we could not let him go without organizing 
something in his honor. Jean-Do had a tremendous influence in the field 
of statistical ecology with important contributions in (among others) 
multivariate analyses, software developments, population dynamics, and 
capture-recapture methods. On a personal side, I would simply not be here 
in science without him. Many friends and colleagues came or sent a message for the occasion. 
These interventions were filmed,

enjoy.
