As one of our always excellent department seminar, we had the chance to welcome 
<a href="http://conservationbiology.uw.edu/conservation-canines/conservation-canines-staff/" target="_blank">Heath 
Smith from University of Washington, Center for Conservation Biology</a>. Heath, together 
with his dog Chester with whom I became friend during the talk, is working with detection 
dogs on all sorts of important questions and organisms in conservation biology. Heath then 
headed to the Pyrénées with Nathalie Espuno to meet with our colleagues from the ONCFS 
bear (dream)team with whom we're working 
on Blaise Piédallu's 
PhD. They're gonna try this technique there, no doubt the results will be of 
interest for our work on large carnivores!
