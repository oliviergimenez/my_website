**Nina Santostasi** (PhD 2016-2019) developed capture-recapture and demographic models 
for studying hybridization in the wild. As case studies, she considered dolphins in the Gulf of 
Corinth in Greece (with Giovanni Bearzi and Silvia Bonizzoni from [Dolphin Biology and 
Conservation](http://www.dolphinbiology.org/)) and wolves in Italy (with [Paolo 
Ciucci](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Paolo_Ciucci) from University of Rome - 
La Sapienza). Nina is now a post-doc with Paolo working on estimating population abundance of brown bears.

![](/img/tamar.png)
**Tamar Lok** (post-doc 2015-2017) developed population models to combine colour-banding, 
tracking and count data to assess within- and between-individual 
variation in different aspects of migratory behaviour of the Eurasian Spoonbill and 
the Red Knot. Tamar is back to the Netherlands where [she is a researcher](https://www.nioz.nl/en/about/organisation/staff/tamar-lok).
