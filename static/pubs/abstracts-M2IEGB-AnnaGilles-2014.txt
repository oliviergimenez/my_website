Anna Lenoël - Abundance and social structure of the Risso's dolphin in the North-Western Mediterranean Sea

Risso’s dolphins Grampus griseus remains a poorly-known species. The Mediterranean subpopulation
being listed as “Data deficient” on the French IUCN list, studying its abundance
and behavior are much needed to implement proper conservation actions. Here we aimed at
enhancing knowledge about the demography and the social organization of the population that
lives in the North-Western Mediterranean Sea. Using a combination of photo-identification
and capture-recapture models we estimated abundances from 1991 to 2012 while accounting
for various sources of heterogeneity in the detection process. Besides, we described the
association patterns among the population using a non-hierarchical clustering method. The
abundance ranged from 77 (SE = 53) to 1028 (SE = 295) individuals, large intervals being
correlated with a low resighting rate. When heterogeneity in the detection process was
accounted for, population size was reevaluated to be ~23% higher than when it was ignored.
We also found low but significant rates of association between individuals that seemed to
correspond to geographic groups. Our study is a first step towards the understanding of a
social structure and the definition of a conservation status for the Risso’s dolphin population.

Key words: abundance estimation, clustering, Cormack-Jolly-Seber model, issue of
detectability < 1, population structure, Risso’s dolphin

Gilles Maurer - Bioeconomic modelling of the dynamic of captive elephant populations in Laos

Laos has a tradition of raising Asian elephants for centuries. However the captive population
has plummeted over the past twenty years due to the intensification of work in the logging
industry in a country recently opening up to the market economy. This study aims at
describing the dynamics of an exploited population of Asian elephants in Laos, paying
particular attention to the determinants of its fecundity. We adopted a population demography
modeling framework, making an explicit link between fecundity and elephant owners profit
maximization. Our results show that fecundity is impacted by i) the dynamics of wild elephant
pool through the mating of captive females by wild males, and ii) the financial inducement of
elephant owners to breed their animal. As a result, we expect fecundity to rise again gradually
in response to the rapid increase in elephants’ prices. Our bio-economic approach allows
describing the underlying dynamics, including interactions with the wild pool, that govern the
demography of captive elephants in Laos. Our results provide new ecological-economic
equilibriums that will serve as a basis for designing recommendations for a sustainable
management of the species.

Key words : Asian elephant – Bio-economics – Demography – Elephas maximus – Lao PDR –
Modeling – Wild / captive interactions.
