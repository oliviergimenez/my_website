We organised a 2-day workshop on the metrics of longevity used in human and 
animal demography. The idea is to explore potential bridges between the two fields. 
Next meeting in April. The group is led by S. Cubaynes, a former PhD student of mine,
who now holds a lecturer position at Montpellier University.
