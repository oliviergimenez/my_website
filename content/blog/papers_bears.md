Among the papers we published lately, Iâ€™d like to emphasize two contributions 
on the conservation of brown bears with some eminent colleagues:

- Karamanlidis, A.A., M. de Gabriel Hernando, L. Krambokoukis, O. Gimenez (2015). 
<a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/23160641/my-pubs/Karamanlidisetal2015-Arcturos.pdf" target="_blank">Evidence 
of a large carnivore population recovery: counting bears in Greece</a>. Journal for Nature Conservation. 
This is a joint venture with 
<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alexandros_Karamanlidis" target="_blank">Alex</a> and the 
Greek <a href="http://www.arcturos.gr/en/main.php" target="_blank">Arcturos NGO</a> in which 
we provide the first reliable abundance estimates for brown bears in Greece.

- Bischof, R., H. Broseth, O. Gimenez (2015). 
<a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/conl.12183/abstract" target="_blank">Wildlife 
in a politically divided world: insularism inflates estimates of brown bear abundance</a>. 
Conservation Letters. <a href="https://www.nmbu.no/ans/richard.bischof" target="_blank">Richard</a> 
had this very clever idea to use spatially-explicit capture-recapture models to assess to what 
extent abundance estimates are affected by double-counting animals that move across borders - 
see <a href="http://conservationmagazine.org/2015/05/bears-without-borders/" target="_blank">here</a> 
for a nice summary of our work.
