<img src="/img/adelaide.jpeg" width="150"> **Célian Monchy** (PhD 2022-2025) is working on the propagation of uncertainties related to the automatic processing of sensor data in different models in ecology. He is co-supervised by [Marie-Pierre Etienne](https://marieetienne.github.io/).

<img src="/img/lea.jpg" width="130"> **Léa Pautrel** (PhD 2022-2025) is investigating the use of deep learning coupled with continuous-time models to exploit sensor data, in particular cam traps. She is co-supervised by [Marie-Pierre Etienne](https://marieetienne.github.io/) and Sylvain Moulherat from [TerrOïko](https://www.terroiko.fr/fr).

**Maëlis Kervellec** (PhD 2021-2024) is developing statistical models for the analysis of camera trap data with applications in large carnivores population ecology. This is joint work with colleagues from the [French Office of Biodiversity](https://ofb.gouv.fr/)

**Oksana Grente** (PhD 2018-2021, post-doc 2023-2025) works at evaluating the impact of lethal control on the French wolf population, with a special interest in social structure and livestock depredation. This is joint work with Sarah Bauduin, Christophe Duchamp and Nolwenn Hoguet-Drouet from [French Office of Biodiversity](https://ofb.gouv.fr/).

**Simon Lacombe** (PhD 2023-2026) is a quantitative ecologists who's determining the drivers of European otter recolonization in France using non-invasive sampling and statistical ecology. He is co-supervised by Sébastien Devillard.
