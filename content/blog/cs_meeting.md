After a month off, I’m back to work starting with a 2-day workshop on citizen sciences 
I’ve co-organised with Romain Julliard and Pascal Monestiez 
([program](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/23160641/my-pubs/prog_16_17_octobre_v4.pdf)) 
as part of [our group on Statistical Ecology](https://sites.google.com/site/gdrecostat/) 
and on citizen sciences [CiSStats](http://ciam.inra.fr/cisstats/accueil). The discussions 
were stimulating with a nice balance between talks given by data providers on the first 
day and modelers on the second day. I gave a talk based on Anne-Sophie’s work on 
mapping brown bear distribution in Greece using opportunistic data. Slides below:

Check out below Anne-Sophie's 
talk she gave at the 2014 International 
Conference on Bear Research and Management in Thessaloniki (Greece) and at the 
joint BES-SFE 
Ecology conference in Lille.
