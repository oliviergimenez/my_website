I acted as president of the examining committee of 
<a href="http://www.eec.univ-montp2.fr/people/sarah-calba/" target="_blank">Sarah 
Calba</a> who defended her PhD in epistemology of sciences with the predictions in 
community ecology as a case study. The thesis was supervised by two clever colleagues 
of mine, Virginie Maris and Vincent Devictor. Sarah did more than well, and the 
discussions were lively and the debate vivid. As a general comment, I wish we, as 
ecologists, had more time as part of our training to think of why and how we conduct 
our scientific activities. Sarah has 
a <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/geb.12148/abstract" target="_blank">nice 
paper</a> showing that the identification of patterns and processes linking species 
diversity to functional or phylogenetic diversity depends on the methodological choices 
we make as analysts. This reminds me of 
the <a href="http://andrewgelman.com/2012/11/01/researcher-degrees-of-freedom/" target="_blank">discussion 
about "Researcher Degrees of Freedom"</a> on Gelmanâ€™s blog.
