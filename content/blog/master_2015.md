My 2 master students finished their internships. I was 
so lucky to have them and work with them. Iago worked on the estimation of abundance 
using bilateral photo-identification capture-recapture data, with an application to 
bottlenose dolphins. He made a very neat contribution to the field by greatly 
improving existing algorithms 
(<a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/biom.12045/abstract" target="_blank">here</a> and 
<a href="http://www.esajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1890/12-1613.1" target="_blank">here</a>) to 
fit capture-recapture models to these non-standard data. Julie worked on inferring the 
distribution of wolves in France from the beginning of its recolonization in the early 90’s. 
Her main contribution was to show that by carefully describing observers’ characteristics 
and properly quantify the prospection effort, citizen science data can be used to map the 
range dynamics of species with large dispersal distances and home ranges. Iago will 
spend next year improving his (already largely above the average) skills in informatics, 
AI, programming, agent-based modeling... Hopefully, we’ll work again together. Julie is 
applying for PhD grants, more soon.
