We visited our colleagues from <a href="http://www.dolphinbiology.org/" target="_blank">Dolphin 
Biology and Conservation</a> (Giovanni Bearzi, Silvia Bonizzoni, Nina Santostasi ‎and‎‎ Eva Greene). 
Lots of discussions on future projects about the estimation of striped, bottlenose and 
common dolphins abundance, their distribution in the gulf of Corinth (Greece) and their 
interactions with fishermen. Nina will be visiting us in October-March to work on the 
abundance project. We also went out for a survey and spotted several groups of striped 
dolphins, and two common dolphins. Thanks to Giovanni and Silvia for their hospitality 
and kindness. The beginning of a new adventure in Greece!
