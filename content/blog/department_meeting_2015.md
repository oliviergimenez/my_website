We had our annual department day; for the occasion, we invited Anne-Caroline 
Prévot. Anne-Caro is having a fascinating scientific pathway, as she started with a 
PhD in bird population dynamics and now she’s working on topics requiring skills in 
environmental psychology. Google her, you’ll see for yourself, her work is awesome. 
For this special day, we opted for a particular format, with less science than usual, 
the idea being to show what’s going on behind the scenes. We had a roundtable on the 
link between research, managers and citizens. We also had several short unorthodox 
talks where we tried to analyse why some of our papers/projects were successful, 
but also why we failed at being read or funded. Interestingly, 
<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/robresearchsite/" target="_blank">Rob 
Salguero-Gomez</a>, a colleague of ours, wrote a nice piece on the topic 
<a href="http://decision-point.com.au/?article=why-academics-should-communicate-failure&lang=fr" target="_blank">here</a>.
Last, we gathered several persons with various professional profiles so that our students 
 could ask them all the questions they wanted. Overall, I think it went amazingly well, 
 and all the attendees found something to take home with them.
