As part of the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/gdrecostat/themes" target="_blank">GdR 
EcoStat and our evolutionary demography group</a>, we had a stimulating workshop on the 
quantification of individual heterogeneity in survival of wild populations 
using <a href="http://www.demographic-research.org/volumes/vol31/19/" target="_blank">an 
approach recently developed by Hal Caswell</a>. Hal attended the workshop with Lotte de 
Vries her new PhD student who will be leading the study.
