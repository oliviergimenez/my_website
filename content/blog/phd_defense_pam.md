Paméla Lagrange successfully defended her PhD co-supervised with M. Bélisle from the 
University of Sherbrooke on the 'Drivers of survival and breeding dispersal using a 
capture-recapture framework in Tree Swallows - Québec'. The members of the committee 
(M. Festa-Bianchet, G. Gauthier, C. Barbraud, E. Cam) were unanimously amazed by both 
the ecological and methodological contributions of Paméla to the field. Congrats Pam!
