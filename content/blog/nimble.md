I attended Daniel Turek's talk at ISEC about <a href="http://r-nimble.org/" target="_blank">NIMBLE</a> 
a neat alternative to WinBUGS and JAGS. It is developed by 
<a href="http://nature.berkeley.edu/~pdevalpine/" target="_blank">Perry de Valpine's 
group</a> at Berkeley and <em>'lets you use BUGS models natively in R, program functions 
that use them, and compile everything via C++ for faster computing'.</em> I played around 
with NIMBLE a bit, <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/23160641/my-codes/cjs-nimble.R" target="_blank">here</a> 
is an example of fitting a classic capture-recapture model to simulated data - thanks to Perry 
and Daniel for their help! NIMBLE seems a lot faster than its competitors, and much more flexible. 
I'll continue my investigations with more complex models - stay tuned.
